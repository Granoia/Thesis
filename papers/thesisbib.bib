Abstract = {{Signaling pathways function as the information-passing mechanisms of
   cells. A number of databases with extensive manual curation represent
   the current knowledge base for signaling pathways. These databases
   motivate the development of computational approaches for prediction and
   analysis. Such methods require an accurate and computable representation
   of signaling pathways. Pathways are often described as sets of proteins
   or as pairwise interactions between proteins. However, many signaling
   mechanisms cannot be described using these representations. In this
   opinion, we highlight a representation of signaling pathways that is
   underutilized: the hypergraph. We demonstrate the usefulness of
   hypergraphs in this context and discuss challenges and opportunities for
   the scientific community.}},
